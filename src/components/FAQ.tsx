Some patients with higher cavity risk or specific dental conditions may need more frequent visits as determined by their dentist."

Eligible children receive up to $1,000 in benefits over 2 calendar years. Cosmetic treatments are generally not covered."
            },
            {
                question: "When should kids first visit the dentist?",
                answer: "Children should have their first dental visit by age 1 or within 6 months of their first tooth appearing. Early visits help establish good oral hygiene habits, allow us to monitor development, and help children become comfortable with dental care in a fun, supportive environment."
